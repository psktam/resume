{\Huge Peter Kim}

I am seeking a fulfilling career in controls engineering and specifically
in the pursuit of making sustainable energy technologies more viable. There
is little need to belabor the point that the way we produce and consume
energy needs to rapidly change if we are to continue thriving on this 
planet as a whole human race. Any strategy geared towards combating climate
change must also take in stride the need to provide for the higher demand
for energy that modern society imposes on the world, and I wish to 
participate in making that happen.

I have an extensive background automating systems of all kinds.
